**Project Description**:
This project focuses on detecting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning techniques. PCOS is a prevalent hormonal disorder among women, and its timely detection is crucial for effective treatment. The project leverages medical datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms to classify and predict PCOS cases accurately.

**Key Objectives**:
Preprocess and analyze PCOS-related datasets.
Develop machine learning models for reliable classification.
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Provide insights into the most influential factors contributing to PCOS.

**Key Features**:
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling and selection for optimal performance.
Machine Learning Models:
Implementation of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Comparison of model performance using standardized evaluation metrics.
Visualization and Insights:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding trends and patterns in the dataset.
Visualization of results and feature importance.
